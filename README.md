# scc0251 - Final Project : Segmentation of Handwritten Notes for Fast Flash Card Generation

This is my final project of the Image Processing lectures lectioned at the ICMC-USP in 2020.01.

## Abstract

The goal here is to create a an algorithm capable of 1) receiving real photos of handwritten students notebooks in which blocks of content are highlighted and 2) Returning the SEGMENTATED region with only the highlighted content (this will be a side of a flash card), while also 3) using OCR to retrieve textual information that could be used for recommending tags for the flash card.
